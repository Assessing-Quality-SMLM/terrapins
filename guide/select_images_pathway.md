If you want your results to go to a specific directory fill in the working directory information

Fill in the instrumentation details and the magnification your images are rendered at.

If you have a true widefield image either fill in its file path or click use image and select it from the drop down.

If you opened the workflow before you loaded your image click reset images in the bottom left corner to re-populate the dropdown.

![Select a widefield with the dropdown](./guide/images/select_widefield_loaded_into_image_j)


Do the same for the image stack if you have it. N.B if the image stack is large leave it on disk rather than load it to ImageJ.

Repeat this for the HAWK image and the FRC splits if you have them.
