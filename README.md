# TERRAPINS - TEsting Resolution, Reliability And Performance IN SMLM 

# What's the point / Scope? 
A number of techniqeus exist for assessing the quality of data produced in a super resolution experiment however, they all measure something slightly different. Alongside this in order to fully intepret their results sometimes information from other tools are required. This means they should be used together to provide a fuller picture of any issues that may be present in your data. 

Whilst several of these tools exist in isolation, this project aims to provide all the tools in one place, accessible across operating systems and analysis platforms to be integrated into users workflows as they see fit. To this end these tools are accessible as ImageJ plugins, Napari plugins and command line tools as well as being open source for anyone to compile as they see fit (we can also create some C API shared objects / dlls / dylibs for integration into other tools if required). 

# Who's it for?
Anyone doing super-res! However, we are focussing providing easy to use tools for people new to the technique.
